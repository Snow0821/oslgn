Operand-Selective Logic Gate Networks (OSLGN) construct neural models using symbolic logic gate structures. By selecting operands and logic operators at each layer, OSLGN enables a modular architecture that reflects discrete symbolic computations. Unlike prior approaches that approximate logical rules via fuzzy semantics, our model preserves the syntactic structure of logic circuits throughout training.
