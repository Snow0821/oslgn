Inspired by the information flow properties of small-world networks~\cite{watts1998collective, javaheripi2019swnet}, we initialize operand selectors using Gaussian-weighted connectivity centered on local input indices. While not a true small-world topology, this bias promotes modular selection patterns and improves convergence speed, as demonstrated in Section~\ref{sec:experiments}. This structural prior reflects local coherence and allows long-range dependencies to emerge during learning.
