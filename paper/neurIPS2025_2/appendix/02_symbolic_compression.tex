\label{appendix:symbolic}

The symbolic logic expressions for each output class were derived from the trained OSLGN model (depth=4, 10 epochs). Each expression was reconstructed by backtracking the operand/operator paths through each logic layer. The code implementation is fully available at:

The original expressions from the model and their compressed forms are presented below.
