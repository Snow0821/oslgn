To complement the figures in Section~\ref{subsec:Depth Scaling}, Table~\ref{tab:depth_summary} presents a summary of performance metrics for each evaluated depth. 
We report the final and peak validation accuracy across 50 training epochs, along with final validation loss and training accuracy. 
This helps assess both convergence stability and generalization behavior. 
Notably, while depth-4 exhibits both high final and peak accuracy, deeper networks like depth-8 show a wider gap between final and peak accuracy, indicating slower convergence or slight overfitting.
