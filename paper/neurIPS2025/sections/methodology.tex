In this section, we describe the detailed structure of our Operand Selective Logic Gated Neural Network (OSLGN).

\subsection{Operand Selector}
The Operand Selector is designed to (explain briefly). It is mathematically formulated as follows:
\[
\text{(Your mathematical formulation here)}
\]

\subsection{Operator Selector}
The Operator Selector selects operators based on (brief explanation):
\[
\text{(Your mathematical formulation here)}
\]

\subsection{OSLGN Architecture}
The overall model architecture integrates Operand and Operator Selectors:
\[
\text{(Your overall architecture formulation)}
\]

Our proposed algorithm consists of the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Step 1: ...
    \item Step 2: ...
\end{enumerate}
