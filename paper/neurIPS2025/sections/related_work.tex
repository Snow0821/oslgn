In this section, we review previous studies on logic gate-based neural networks and operand/operator selection methods.

\paragraph{Logic Gate-based Neural Networks}
Prior works include studies such as \citep{example2023}, which introduced methods based on logical operations.

\paragraph{Operand and Operator Selection}
Related studies on operand/operator selection include \citep{example2024}. Our work differs from these approaches by (explain your differentiation clearly).
